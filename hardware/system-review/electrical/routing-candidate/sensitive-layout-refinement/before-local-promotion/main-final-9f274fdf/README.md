# Main PCB — routed prototype review package, HOLD

The canonical KiCad project is [Trimix_Analyzer.kicad_pro](../../../pcb/analyzer/Trimix_Analyzer.kicad_pro). The board SHA256 is `9f274fdf198f1bcb871a4fc360e76693f8a5b048553e6a02998141737956514f`. It passes native DRC, connectivity and schematic parity with zero findings. The previous draft is preserved in `../routing-candidate/final-cleanup/before-final-promotion/`.

## Files to review

- [All references, values, MPNs and positions](cam/assembly-reference-map.csv): 169 physical references.
- [Purchasing BOM](cam/purchasing-bom.csv), [factory BOM](cam/factory-bom.csv), [manual BOM](cam/manual-bom.csv), [DNP list](cam/dnp-list.csv), [PCB/harness features](cam/pcb-features.csv).
- [Factory placement](cam/placement-factory.csv) and [all exported placements](cam/placement-all.csv). Use the printed side/rotation fields; do not infer orientation from a generic 3D marking.
- [Printed-reference legend](cam/marking-legend.csv): 146 references are on silk. The 23 assembly-only references have locator sheets [1](assembly-drawings/assembly-only-locators-1.svg), [2](assembly-drawings/assembly-only-locators-2.svg), [3](assembly-drawings/assembly-only-locators-3.svg), [4](assembly-drawings/assembly-only-locators-4.svg). Blue shows the selected pads. Both sides use explicitly labelled top-view coordinates; rear probing requires PCB removal.
- [Factory-only paste source and derivation](factory-stencil/derivation-receipt.json), with `.gtp/.gbp` files in `factory-stencil/cam/`. These omit all manual/DNP paste, including C706. Use these for assembler review; the full-board paste files in `cam/` are diagnostic exports, not the factory subset.
- [27-hole fill/cap process](fill-cap-process/README.md), [exact hole list](fill-cap-process/required-fill-cap-holes.csv), [coordinate map](fill-cap-process/fill-cap-map.svg): all 24 package thermal bores plus 3 signal VIPPO require resin fill and copper cap on both faces.
- [Source-matched STEP](../Trimix_Main_PCB_Reviewed_Placement.step) and [maximum-height envelopes](../component-height-contract.csv). The STEP has normal pad thickness; no purchased part was scaled. Generic/absent visual models must be checked against the independent envelopes.
- [Native netlist](../analyzer-netlist.xml), [connector/testpoint pin map](../connector-testpoint-pinmap.csv), [selection qualification](../part-qualification.csv), [raw ERC](../main-erc.json), [DRC](../main-drc.json).

## Verification and limits

Independent exported-byte review passed 44 copper/drill/connectivity checks, 20 assembly-list checks and 50 process checks. [Independent receipt](../main-final-independent/final-9f274fdf/verification-receipt.json). One external factory-qualification hold remains: actual fill/cap, flatness, stencil thickness/paste volume, joint coverage/voids, inspection and double-sided reflow are not established by the digital files.

The source audit passes 217 electrical assertions and rejects all 12 representative injected wiring/value faults. Raw ERC retains one exact TI-permitted LM66100 ST-to-ground exception; the guarded review finds no unexpected ERC errors or warnings. Root review preserves all 29 critical conductor witnesses, continuous In1 and every reviewed ground anchor. [Root verification](../routing-candidate/final-cleanup/root-review/final-contract-erc-review.json), [power/ground review](../routing-candidate/final-cleanup/root-review/final-power-ground-review.json).

J104 remains open. No charging, fabrication or assembly order is authorized by these files. Exact cell/NTC, host input/mating harness, sensor/mechanical interfaces, factory process, final enclosure integration and physical startup/current/transient/thermal/EMC/gas/calibration qualifications remain in the system acceptance ledger. Routing completion and source consistency do not resolve those holds.

The USB daughterboard remains a separate frozen package under `../usb-final/`, including its unresolved GCT edge/annular process requirements. Do not substitute the main-board process for the 0.60 mm daughterboard.
