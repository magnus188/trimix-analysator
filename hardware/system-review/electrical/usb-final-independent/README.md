# Independent USB Gerber and drill review

**34 checks passed, zero export discrepancies. Fabrication remains held.**
This review parses the actual frozen Gerber/Excellon files under
`../usb-final/manufacturing-diagnostic/`. It does not call KiCad's PCB API,
connectivity engine, renderer, or the original export/audit scripts. No PCB,
schematic, manufacturing export or production software was changed.

## Results

- All **53 top/bottom copper pad flashes** match the native pad centres,
  shapes, sizes, rotations and X2 pin/net names. These represent **35 unique
  schematic pin/net mappings** and preserve repeated/split physical lands.
- The **94 track objects, 14 vias, 22 round plated holes and four plated slots**
  match the native geometry. There are no unplated holes. The track count
  includes seven duplicate same-net track objects on each layer; those are
  also present in the native file. They add no separate copper and do not
  change the connectivity result. They were not removed from frozen sources.
- The 18 Gerber profile segments/arcs match the native outline and make one
  closed profile, **16.00 × 15.72 mm**, with centre-line area about 177.990 mm².
- Pure copper geometry, joined between layers only at plated holes, produces
  **eight connected components**: six intended nets and two isolated SBU
  pads. There are no mixed-net components, missing connections or copper
  outside the outline. Minimum measured same-layer net clearance is 0.150 mm.
- U901's external **1–10, 2–9, 4–7 and 5–6** bridges are continuous 0.15 mm
  copper. Four in-memory failure controls remove one bridge at a time; every
  removal splits that net into two islands. No internal ESD-chip connection,
  connector shell shortcut, or duplicate-pin shortcut is assumed.
- All four separate `SH` slots connect to ground. The six J902 positions
  preserve **1 VBUS, 2 GND, 3 CC1, 4 CC2, 5 D+, 6 D−**, at 1.8 mm pitch.
- All front/back mask lands, front paste lands and the separate U901 central
  0.4 × 0.6 mm paste region match native geometry. Bottom paste and silkscreen
  are intentionally empty. This is an export comparison, not stencil approval.
- Native, BOM and CPL each contain four assemblies once. All CPL positions,
  rotations, sides, packages and values match; the three exact purchased MPNs
  remain distinct from the unresolved custom harness assembly.
- Twenty exported GCT copper-edge instances reproduce the **0.10/0.15 mm**
  margins. The two round connector holes retain **0.15 mm annular rings**.
  These do not satisfy the previously selected 0.20 mm edge/0.18 mm annular
  process targets. Native DRC still records all **22 process findings**.
  Manufacturer/assembler approval, route tolerance, slot and fine-USON assembly
  qualification remain required. This report does not convert them to passes.

## Views and evidence

- `gerber-top.svg/.png`, `gerber-bottom.svg/.png`: flat copper/net views with
  actual drill openings and outline. **Both use top coordinates**; the bottom
  image is not mirrored. Top labels include actual exported silkscreen.
- `esd-bridges-detail.svg/.png`: magnified actual top copper with X2 pin labels.
- `F-Cu.svg`, `B-Cu.svg`, `F-Mask.svg`, `B-Mask.svg`, `F-Paste.svg`,
  `Edge-Cuts.svg`: the parser's own single-layer monochrome SVG output.
- `audit.json`: all checks, pad comparisons, connectivity groups, every
  measured net clearance, drill/placement results, limitations and frozen input
  SHA256 values. Twenty-one inputs also match the original frozen export receipt.
- `verification.log`, `review-receipt.json`: execution summary, source/artifact
  binding and the root reviewer's recorded visual inspection.

Root visually inspected the top, bottom and ESD detail PNGs: square harness
pad 1/six-wire order, four independent ESD bridges, two isolated SBU lands and
plane/slot pattern were consistent with the reviewed mapping. Inspection is
limited to rendered exported geometry; it is not a fabrication or physical pass.

## Reproduction and tool provenance

Temporary interpreter: `/tmp/trimix-gerbonara-venv/bin/python`.

```sh
/tmp/trimix-gerbonara-venv/bin/python hardware/system-review/electrical/usb-final-independent/audit_exports.py
```

The environment contains [Gerbonara 1.6.3](https://pypi.org/project/gerbonara/1.6.3/),
Shapely 2.1.2, sexpdata 1.0.2 and CairoSVG 2.8.2. Full transitive versions are
in `requirements.lock.txt`; `tool-install-report.json` records public PyPI
artifact URLs and SHA256 values. The Gerbonara wheel hash matches PyPI's
published value `fccf782acdc98e80e3a418b7ed57d35c4f6ac7a8bc5e5d3ddc48bdd870919be2`.
Nothing was installed globally. Gerbonara's [official documentation](https://gerbolyze.gitlab.io/gerbonara/)
describes the parser and SVG APIs used here.

## Numerical and parser limits

Circular polygons use 96 segments per quadrant; curved outline approximation
uses a 0.00001 mm chord-error target. A 0.00001 mm endpoint grid closes a
0.000001 mm endpoint quantization difference in the exported outline. Contact
comparison allows 0.000002 mm; these numerical settings are not manufacturing
tolerances. Maximum native/export pad-shape difference is below 0.000000001 mm.

Gerbonara warns that KiCad puts `G90` after the Excellon header; its decoded
absolute metric drill positions and shapes were verified against all native
holes. Gerbonara 1.6.3 does not retain X2 attributes on filled Region objects.
The review leaves these region attributes unknown and derives their net only
from physical contact to attributed pad/track copper. Disjoint region polygons
are separate graph nodes. No parser source was patched. Flat SVG avoids the
SVG filter effects that CairoSVG does not faithfully reproduce in Gerbonara's
optional photorealistic renderer.

Solderability, finished-hole/route tolerances, wire fit, current/temperature,
USB source behaviour, VBUS transient protection, ESD, sealing and enclosure
fit remain separate physical or system-level checks. Manufacturer pin
correctness is supported by the existing primary-source review, rather than
inferred from Gerber labels. This bounded review covers the USB daughterboard;
it is not an independent CAM pass for the main PCB.
